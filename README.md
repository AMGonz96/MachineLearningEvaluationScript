# MachineLearningEvaluationScript
A Script that can be used to easily evaluate various machine learning modals for classification

The script requires an input of data in a pre-cleaned CSV file.

The script will then break the data into train test sets, train each of the models and then evaluate the performance with the test data.

The score of the tests are then printed out and saved into a CSV file when done.
